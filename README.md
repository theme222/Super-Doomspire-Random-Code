# Super-Doomspire-Random-Code
run the code and the challenge will be there plus everything else
ALSO I'm A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER SO DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING FANCY IN HERE JUST RUN THE CODE AND YOU'll BE FINE
if you wanna change anything you can if you wanna I'll prob not update this tho
this is made in python 3.8 i think so yea you might wanna download that
but if you don't wanna download you can just copy the file into https://repl.it/languages/python3 fun fact I made this during class
